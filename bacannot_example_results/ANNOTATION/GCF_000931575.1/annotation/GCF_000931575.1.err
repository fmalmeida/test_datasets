DISC_COUNT_NUCLEOTIDES:1 nucleotide Bioseqs are present
FEATURE_LOCATION_CONFLICT:1824 features have inconsistent gene locations.
OVERLAPPING_CDS:8 coding regions overlap another coding region with a similar or identical name.
SUSPECT_PRODUCT_NAMES:55 product_names contain suspect phrase or characters
	May contain database identifier more appropriate in note; remove from product name
